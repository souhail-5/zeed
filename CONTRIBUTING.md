Zeed is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into zeed itself.

## How to?
We use GitHub to track issues, bugs and feature requests. Please feel free to [open an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue).

We also use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through Pull Requests. Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

### Deploying a new release
To deploy a new release of Zeed, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure all new changes have been added to the Zeed staging area.
2. Verify that your code is ready for deployment. This means all tests have passed, the code has been reviewed, and all issues have been resolved, etc.
3. Create a new release tag in the format `vX.Y.Z-release` (e.g., `v1.0.0-release`) and push it to the repository.
4. Once the tag is pushed, the CI/CD pipeline should automatically build and publish the new release.
5. Finally, confirm the new release is available for download from the Releases page.
