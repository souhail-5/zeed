# Zeed
Zeed is a free and open source tool to eliminate changelog-related merge conflicts. Team collaboration and continuous integration will be easier.

**How it works?** Use Zeed to add any entry to your changelog. Zeed will not modify your changelog file, but save your entries as a file within a staging area. When you are ready, you ask Zeed to unify all staged entries, and render them according to a template. Copy/Paste the rendering to your changelog file. Use Zeed to delete the staged entries and start over for another release.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you Zeed up and running on your local machine.

### Technical prerequisites
Zeed is written with support for multiple platforms. Zeed currently provides binaries for the following:

- macOS (Darwin) for x64, i386, and ARM architectures
- Windows
- Linux

### How to install?

Download the appropriate version for your platform from [Zeed Releases](https://github.com/souhail-5/zeed/releases). Once downloaded, the binary can be run from anywhere.

Ideally, you should install it somewhere in your `PATH` for easy use. `/usr/local/bin` is the most probable location.

Verify your installation by running `zeed --version`.

## Basic usage

- Init Zeed within your project `zeed init`
- Add an entry `zeed "I am a changelog entry"`
- Add another entry `zeed "All changelog entries are saved within <your_project_dir>/.zeed/"`
- Unify the entries and output the result `zeed unify`
- Unify then copy/paste the result at a specific location of your changelog file `zeed unify -a "## Releases"`
- Unify then delete the entries `zeed unify --flush`
- Copy/Paste the unified entries in your current changelog file

## Advanced usage

The following sections outline advanced usage topics: weights, channels, templates and unifying.

### How to work with weights?
Weights serve to sort the entries. Each entry is given a weight. The default given weight is `0`. Entries are sorted in descending order.

To give a specific weight to an entry, set the `--weight` (or `-w`) option when adding an entry: `zeed "I am a changelog entry" --weight 64`.

### How to work with channels?
Channels serve to group the entries. Each entry is attached to a channel. The default attached channel is `default`.

To attach a specific channel to an entry, set the `--channel` (or `-c`) option when adding an entry: `zeed "I am a changelog entry" --channel name_of_your_channel`. Only channels supported by your project are allowed.

#### How to add your own channel?
To add support for a channel in your project, edit `.zeed/.zeed.yaml` file that way:
``` yaml
channels:
  - added
  - changed
  - deprecated
  - fixed
  - removed
  - security
  - name_of_your_channel # Only a-z and _ are allowed
```

Channels serve to group the entries, so it will be useful for templates.

### How to work with templates?
Templates serve to customize the rendering of the unified entries. The template used by default is `default`.

To unify the entries with a specific template, set the `--template` (or `-t`) option when unifying the entries: `zeed unify --template name_of_the_template`. Only templates supported by your project are allowed.

Zeed comes with built-in allowed templates:
- `default`: one line for each entry
- `keepachangelog`: compliant with the [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/) format

#### How to add your own template?
Templates must use [Go templating engine](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/). They have access to these data :
- `Entries`: list of all entries. Each entry include these fields:
  - `Text`: entry's text
  - `FrontMatter`: entry's metadata
    - `Channel`: entry's channel
    - `Weight`: entry's weight
- `Channels`: list of all entries grouped by channel name

To add your own template, edit `.zeed/.zeed.yaml` file that way:
``` yaml
templates:
  default: "{{range .Entries}}â€¢ {{.Text}}\n{{end}}" # overrides the built-in "default" template
  slack: |-
    *What's new?*
    {{range .Entries -}}
    - {{.Text}}
    {{end}}
  name_of_the_template: |
    {{range .Entries -}}
    {{- if eq .FrontMatter.Channel "default" -}}
    - {{.Text}} ({{.FrontMatter.Weight}})
    {{- end}}
    {{- if eq .FrontMatter.Channel "added" -}}
    - [Added] {{.Text}} ({{.FrontMatter.Weight}})
    {{- end}}
    {{end -}}
```

### How to update your changelog file?
When unifying your entries, you have the option to directly place them in your changelog file at a specific location using the `--aline` (or `-a`) and/or `--bline` (or `-b`) options. Be sure to carefully escape the values of these options, as they form part of the built-in Zeed regular expressions that are used to find and insert the unified entries at the correct position within the changelog file.

Examples:
- `zeed unify --aline "## Unreleased"` unifies your entries, then adds them on a new line after the first line containing "## Unreleased".
- `zeed unify --bline "## Version "` unifies your entries, then adds them on a new line before the first line containing "## Version ".
- `zeed unify --aline "## Unreleased" --bline "## "` unifies your entries, then replaces text between the line containing "## Unreleased" and the following line containing "## ".
